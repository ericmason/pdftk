# pdftk compiler flags; 0x2f is a forward slash; 0x5c is a backslash
# if you want pdftk to ask before overwriting a file, set
# ASK_ABOUT_WARNINGS to true; otherwise: false; override this default
# with the dont_ask or do_ask command-line options
#
# drop CXXFLAG -O3 due to template inlining causing:
# "error: mixing C++ and Java catches in a single translation unit" per Andrew Haley;
# fix added for gcc-4.3; this problem might be fixed in 4.4
#
# GCJFLAG -O3 causes pdftk to segfault (during a cat operation) when compiled on sarge using gcc 3.4.4
# per Johann Felix Soden:
# In gcc 4.3 "-O3" gives an error. This is fixed in PR C++/39380 which is at least in debian's gcc 4.4.1-4
#
# GCJFLAG -fsource=1.3 identifies the version of the java source
#
# when building/using a shared itext library:
#   CXXFLAGS: -fpic (or-fPIC)
#   GCJFLAGS: -Wl,-Bsymbolic -fpic (or -fPIC) -Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib/gcj
# stock pdftk links statically against its own, modified itext library
#
# -findirect-dispatch
# introduced in gcj 4:
# "Using that option causes GCJ to generate native code for classes and methods that follow the precise same binary compatibility rules as described in the Java Language Specification."
# http://lwn.net/Articles/130796/
# omitted because it caused linking errors using gcc 4.4; it also seems to make a larger binary
#
# -Wl,--as-needed
# see: http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/asneeded.xml
# only effects libraries following option on the command line
